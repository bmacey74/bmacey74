- 👋 Hi, I’m @bmacey74
- 👀 I’m interested in ...
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to review Warranty Terms and Conditons from Announcements created via Oasis and fed to IBM Documents...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Hardware Warranty Terms and Conditions, International Warranty Service, etc.
- I am the product owner for the Remote Customer System Inventory (RCSI) Laptop App and the iPhone Remote Customer System Inventory iPhone App.  Here is a description of the RCSI App
- The Remote Customer System Inventory (RCSI) application automates the inventory checking tasks prior to installing a system or MES. The IBM Service Representative will install the application
-  on their laptop, download the packing list of parts to the laptop using the RCSI application, then use a bar code scanner to scan the parts shipped. The application will process the scanned parts
-   and let the service representative know if there are any missing parts or extra parts. This process allows the service representative to ensure
- that they received all parts required to install an IBM system or MES. 
- 📫 How to reach me:  bmacey@us.ibm.com, by phone 507 696-6974 or on Slack @bmacey.
